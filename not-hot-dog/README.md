# Not-hot-dog react native app

Use [teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/),
[tfjs](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs), and
[tfjs-react-native](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-react-native)
to build a react-native app that can detect what you are looking at is a hot
dog, or not a hot dog.

Inspired by [Mr. Jian-Yang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJsOA4Zl6Io)
(not Mr. Jian, and not Mr. Yang) from Silicon Valley.
